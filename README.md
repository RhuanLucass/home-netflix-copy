# Netflix Home Page Recreated

This project was developed with the aim of improving my front-end skills using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The recreation focuses on the Netflix home page, where videos and images of content present on the platform are displayed, in addition to a frequently asked questions section.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Functionalities
The page displays videos and images of the content offered on the Netflix platform to demonstrate the variety and quality of the material available.
It also displays frequently asked questions so that users can get their answer immediately

### Frequently Asked Questions Section
I used JavaScript to implement an accordion effect in the FAQ section. This allows users to click on questions to reveal the answers, providing an interactive and organized experience.
